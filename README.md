The Wildlife Monitoring System using Camera Traps is an AI-powered tool designed to support wildlife conservation and ecological research through automated image analysis. Camera traps are widely used to monitor wildlife activity in natural habitats, but manually reviewing thousands of captured images is time-consuming and labor-intensive. This project simplifies that process by applying computer vision to automatically detect and identify animals within the images.
Built using YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art object detection model, this system provides fast, accurate wildlife detection and visualization. It is ideal for conservationists, ecologists, and researchers who need a scalable and efficient solution for analyzing visual data from remote field locations.
The system is implemented in Python and designed to run on Google Colab, allowing users to quickly get started without complex setups. Users can upload their images, run detection, and download annotated results â€” all within a user-friendly, cloud-based environment.
